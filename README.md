## Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan Bravo!
I'm an aspiring Web Dev and Computer Science student at Florida International University.

I've been self-teaching front-end languages and frameworks for about 4 months now.

I am proficient with Front End languages and frameworks such as React.js.

I have also started using Back End more frequently through the likes of Express.js and Node.js.

I am currently learning the complete MERN stack and have started creating some projects with them.
